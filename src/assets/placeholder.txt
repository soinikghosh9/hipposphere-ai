This file is a guide to help you replace all placeholder images in the HippoSphere AI application.

**ACTION REQUIRED: You MUST rename YOUR image files to EXACTLY match the `Filename` listed for each entry below (case-sensitive, including the '.png' extension) and place them in the `./public/images/` directory.**

The `./public/images/` directory path is relative to your `index.html` file. This means:
- Your main project folder contains `index.html`.
- Inside that same main project folder, you must have a folder named `public`.
- Inside the `public` folder, you must have a folder named `images`.
- All your renamed .png image files go into this `public/images/` folder.

Example structure:
YourProjectRoot/
├── index.html
├── public/
│   └── images/
│       ├── frontpage-bg.png
│       ├── moodeng-profile.png
│       └── ... (all other .png images listed below)
└── ... (other project files like index.tsx, App.tsx, etc.)

--- TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST (If images are still not showing locally) ---

1.  **Exact Filenames:** Have you renamed YOUR image files to EXACTLY match the `Filename` specified above for each image?
    *   This includes being case-sensitive (e.g., `frontpage-bg.png` is different from `Frontpage-bg.png` or `frontpage-bg.PNG`).
    *   Ensure the extension is `.png` for all files.

2.  **Correct Folder Structure:**
    *   Is there a folder named `public` in the SAME directory as your `index.html` file?
    *   Inside that `public` folder, is there a folder named `images`?
    *   Are all your `.png` image files placed DIRECTLY inside this `public/images/` folder?

3.  **No Typos:** Double-check for any typos in your folder names (`public`, `images`) or your filenames.

4.  **Browser Cache:** Try clearing your browser's cache completely.
    *   Alternatively, open `index.html` in an incognito/private browsing window. This often bypasses the cache.

5.  **Developer Tools (Essential for Debugging):**
    *   Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12, or right-click on the page and select "Inspect").
    *   Go to the **"Network"** tab.
    *   Reload your `index.html` page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R).
    *   Look for any lines in the Network tab that correspond to your image files (e.g., `frontpage-bg.png`).
    *   If an image failed to load, it will usually be highlighted in red, and its "Status" will be `404 Not Found` or similar.
    *   Click on the failed image request. In the "Headers" section, you can see the exact "Request URL" the browser tried to load. This will tell you if the path is incorrect.
    *   Also check the **"Console"** tab in Developer Tools for any error messages related to loading resources.

By carefully following this guide and the troubleshooting checklist, you should be able to get your images displaying correctly. Good luck!
